# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

If you think you've found a security vulnerability in the EA Hub, please send an email about it to admins@eahub.org. Please don't put it in the issue tracker on GitHub, as that means anyone can see it. We'll respond to all reports as soon as we can; if it's a real vulnerability, we'll keep you updated on its status until it's fixed.
