## Code of Conduct

## How Can I Contribute?  

### Reporting Bugs  
Reporting bugs helps us continuously improving the EA Hub.  

If you think you've found a bug, please check first [here](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/labels/Bug) whether it 
has already been reported.  

If the bug has not been reported, please [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/issues/new). Please 
give as much information as possible:  
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.  
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.  
* Describe the behaviour you observed after following these steps.    
* Explain which behaviour expected to see and why.  
* Provide a screenshot of the bug.  
* Give information about your environment (browser, device, screen width, etc.)  

### Suggesting Enhancements  
You can suggest new features and other improvements on [meta.eahub.org](https://meta.eahub.org/c/feature-requests/). You 
will have to sign up first.  

### Your First Code Contribution  
The EA Hub is an open source project and we welcome developers to make contributions. You can find a list of first good 
GitHub issues to work on [here](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/labels/Good%20First%20Issue).  

If you'd like to work on one of these GitHub issues or would like to pick up another of 
[our GitHUb issues](https://github.com/rtcharity/eahub.org/issues), **please first get in touch with us** so that we 
can discuss which issue would be ideal for you to work on and help you in case you have any questions. To get in touch, 
join the [contributions channel](https://discord.gg/CQueVjk3fc) on EA Hub's discord server and post a short message 
that you'd like to contribute.  

### Git Commit Messages  
Since we have enabled squash-merging, all commits on your branch will be squashed into one when merging into master. 
Having clear commit messages on your branch will, however, make the code review easier. Hence, please follow the following 
guidelines (adapted from [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)) for all commits, but especially for the final, 
squashed one:  
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how  

### Pull Requests  
When making a pull request, put yourself in the shoes of the reviewer and think what information they need to review 
your code effectively.  

In particular, please make sure that:    

1. The pull request has a clear and meaningful title
1. You've referenced the GitHub issue the pull request is addressing  
1. The pull request description:  
- Mentions which changes were made. Where applicable, make clear which changes are "core" changes, and which are just 
refactoring, styling changes etc.      
- Explains why these changes were made  
- Has screenshots of the relevant frontend changes (where applicable)    
1. All status checks have passed
