<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Effective Altruism Hub is here to make it easier for Effective Altruists to get together and collaborate on shared goals. Our vision is to increase visibility for individuals, projects and groups, and to make ideas and opportunities easier to find.</p>
<p>The Hub allows you to create, share or find personal, group and organisation profiles. Users can search for experts, prospective volunteers or employees and for speakers. People can also find, join or start local groups. Each of these entities are helpfully displayed on the interactive map of EAs. Improved privacy settings allow users to customise how they use the Hub.</p>
<p>Having rebooted and enhanced the original functionality of the Hub over 2018, we are launching it in permanent beta mode. In the near future we will be working on introducing even more functionality to the Hub. We will introduce a powerful, cross-platform search which will make content and features on the Hub more intuitive and easy to find. It will also direct users to content from other sites from around the community, reducing fragmentation and increasing the impact of existing resources. We will also introduce a feature for EA projects which will allow people to find or promote their projects, and to connect with collaborators more easily. We also hope to expand functionality for local groups, and to build data visualisation for the EA Survey.</p>
<p>The Hub is an open source project, and we are keen to work with other tech initiatives whenever it makes sense to do so.</p>
