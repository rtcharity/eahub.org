<h1>Rethink Charity Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit eahub.org (the “Site”).</p>

<h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>

<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>

<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</li>
<li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
<li>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally when you register or browse the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, email address, city and country.  We refer to this information as “Account Information.”</p>

<p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Account Information.</p>

<h3>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h3>

<p>We use the Account Information that we collect generally to provide any services offered through the Site (including displaying your profile along others on the world map, providing you with information on other persons and groups in your area, etc.).  Additionally, we use this Account Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with you;</li>
<li>Offer other users the possibility to learn more about you and communicate with you;</li>
<li>Screen our accounts for potential risk or fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

<p>We may create aggregate and other anonymous data from our users’ personal information. We make personal information into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties to operate, understand and improve our platform, to develop new services, and for other lawful purposes.</p>

<h3>Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our users use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

<p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at:  http://optout.aboutads.info/.</p>

Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
